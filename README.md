# LSM9DS1-python-library
This is a Python library that attempts to interface with the LSM9DS1 sensor. Sparkfun's original [Arduino library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_LSM9DS1_Arduino_Library) was used as the basis for this project.

## ðŸ’» Materials
The SEN-13284 from SparkFun was used to test this library, but it should work with other boards, for example, the Adafruit 9-DOF Breakout Board based on the LSM9DS1 chip. It could be purchased at [Mouser](https://www.mouser.es/ProductDetail/Adafruit/4634?qs=W%2FMpXkg%252BdQ6zSzbuDAor%2FQ%3D%3D).
